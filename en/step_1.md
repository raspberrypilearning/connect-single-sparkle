Use a crocodile clip cable to connect the positive output (**+**) on the **right** side of the Crumble to the positive input (**+**) on the **left** side of the Sparkle.

Use another crocodile clip cable to connect the negative output (**-**) on the **right** side of the Crumble to the negative input (**-**) on the **left** side of the Sparkle.

The positive and negative cables supply power to the Sparkle.

Finally, make the signal connection, which must always be to the **D** terminal on the Crumble. Sparkles will not work if connected to any other terminal.

Use a third crocodile clip cable to connect the **D** terminal on the **right** side of the Crumble to the **->D->** input on the **left** side of the Sparkle.

The Crumble uses the signal connection to tell the Sparkle what colour it should be.

And finally, we make the signal connection which must always be to the 'D' terminal on the Crumble. Sparkles will not work if connected to any other terminal.

The positive and negative cables supply power to the Sparkle but it is this signal connections that will tell the Sparkle what colour it should be.

Use a third crocodile clip to connect from the 'D' terminal on the right side of the Crumble to the ->D-> input on the left side of the Sparkle.
